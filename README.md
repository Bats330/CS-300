1. What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
   
The problem we were solving this course was devloping a program using either hashtables,vectors or binary search trees to create a program for ABC university that will take a file filled with class information and load it into a program sorting it and allowing the user
to select specific courses to see the given prerequisites that are involved with that course. In project one we tackled developing ths pseudocode for the program using different methods like hash tables vectors or binary search trees than in project two we developed
a program using our selected method in my case hashtables to make the program using c++

2.How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
  
  I approched the problem by developing differnt methods of pseudo code throughout the course and did research into why each method should or shouldnt be used in comparsion to each other
  Then we looked at the run time of each method to choose which one based on the given requirements to the problem should be used. Then using the pseudo code I developed a working program to
  meet the programs needs. Data strucutres are important to understand since they allow for large amounts of data to be combed through edited and changed with relative ease through
  a program allowing large companies to store data effiecntly.

3. How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
   
   When I encountered roadblocks I would search up my specific issues for examples I am extremly bad with making a pseudo code with out the given program infront of me
   So I had to look up some tips and tricks to help me get a better understanding of them. I also reached out to the instructor for some help and extra resources.

5. How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
   
   My work has expanded my approach in designing programs that may need to store alot of information to try and figure out
   what the best data structure will be into tackling these tasks effiecently I have also expanded my work by developing better
   skills in working through pseudocode.

7. How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
   
   The work on this project evolved the way I write my programs further where I strive for readability and sustainable code
   Allowing me to work through some various different ideas when working on project two without having to change to much of
   the prior code allowing for more modularity and flexability based on the requirements to the given project.
